# CSPB3022FinalProject
Final Project for Intro to Data Science

The attached file is a fake tweet bot detection system. The way it was created was through: 
1) Cleaning the data:
  a) Getting rid of unnecesary columns and values.
  b) Setting some variables into binary choices
2) Doing some data exploration to see if the data had any major flaws.
3) Using different types of modeling to see which would be the most accurate:
  a) Logistic Regression
  b) Decision Tree
  c) Random Forest


## Within the notebook is a more in-depth write-up of what is being done going along with the code, so it is more understandable.
