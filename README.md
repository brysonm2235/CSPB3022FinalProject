# CSPB3022FinalProject
Final Project for Intro to Data Science

Data for the project is to big to be saved here: https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

The attached file is a fake tweet bot detection system. The way it was created was through: 
1) Finding a data set that would fit the goal of this project. What was found were two csv files that had all real tweets on one and all fake tweets on the other.
2) Cleaning the data:
  a) Getting rid of unnecesary columns and values.
  b) Setting some variables into binary choices
3) Doing some data exploration to see if the data had any major flaws.
4) Using different types of modeling to see which would be the most accurate:
  a) Logistic Regression
  b) Decision Tree
  c) Random Forest


## Within the notebook is a more in-depth write-up of what is being done going along with the code, so it is more understandable.
